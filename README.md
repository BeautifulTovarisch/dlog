# Distributed Log

This project is my implementation of the distributed commit log service found
in Travis Jeffery's excellent book [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/).

I decided to deviate significantly from the source code in the book while still
keeping the same core idea.
